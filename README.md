# 🔬 AI Research Assistant

> **Turn a research topic into a structured research report — locally.**

An autonomous research agent that **plans investigations, searches multiple sources, ingests documents, builds a persistent knowledge base, retrieves relevant evidence, and generates structured research reports and papers.**

Built with **LangGraph + LangChain + Ollama**, with a local-first architecture and no external LLM API required.

## Why I Built This

Writing a research paper isn't just writing the paper.

You have to:

* Find relevant papers and sources
*  Read through large amounts of information
*  Break a topic into smaller research questions
*  Keep track of useful information
*  Connect evidence across different sources
*  Turn everything into a structured report

So instead of repeatedly doing those steps manually, I built an agent that can **orchestrate the research workflow for me.**

The goal isn't simply *"ask an LLM a question."*

It's:

> **Give the agent a topic → let it investigate → build knowledge → retrieve evidence → produce a research report.**

The workflow is orchestrated using **LangGraph**, allowing the research process to move through multiple stages instead of relying on a single LLM prompt.

---

# Research Sources

The agent can work with multiple information sources, including:

* Wikipedia
* arXiv
* GitHub
* Semantic Scholar
* Stack Overflow

This allows research to combine information from different types of sources rather than relying on a single search result.

---

# Persistent Knowledge Base

Research doesn't have to disappear after one question.

The agent maintains a persistent local knowledge base where documents can be:

```text
Document
   │
   ▼
Chunk
   │
   ▼
Embedding
   │
   ▼
Vector Store
   │
   ▼
Semantic Retrieval
```

You can then ask questions against previously indexed information.

For example:

```bash
.\run.bat index "Vision Transformers"

.\run.bat ask "How do Vision Transformers differ from CNNs?"
```

The system retrieves the most relevant chunks based on semantic similarity.

---

# Document Ingestion

You can also bring your own research material into the system.

Supported formats include:

```text
PDF
Markdown
Python
Jupyter Notebook
TXT
```

Directories can be ingested recursively:

```bash
.\run.bat ingest ./research_material
```

This makes it possible to build a personal research library and query it later.

---

# 📝 Research Paper Generation

The research agent can turn its findings into structured paper outputs.

```bash
.\run.bat research "Vision Transformers" -i 1 --paper
```

Generated output:

```text
paper_output_<job_id>/
│
├── main.tex
├── main.md
├── references.bib
├── paper_metadata.json
│
└── figures/
    └── extracted_figures...
```

### Output includes

*  arXiv-style LaTeX
*  Markdown version
*  BibTeX references
*  Extracted figures
*  Paper metadata

#  Design Principles

### Local-first

The system is designed around local LLM inference through Ollama rather than requiring an external LLM API.

### Research-oriented

The goal is not just question answering. The workflow is designed around **planning, retrieval, evidence gathering and synthesis**.

### Persistent

Research can be stored and queried again instead of starting from zero every time.

### Modular

Search, ingestion, embeddings, retrieval, analysis and reporting are separated into different components, making the system easier to extend.

### Agentic

The system uses a multi-step graph rather than treating research as a single prompt-response interaction.
